When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote repositories are better when you are working from multiple devices or when collaborating with other programmers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually will allow the user to know the files are being merged at that time. Merging files automatically could always overwrite changes and create issues down the road.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork can only be done within GitHub. Branches are local, and clones are copies of a repository either locally or online.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a copy of the last known state of the remote would allow a programmer to work offline and make changes to the most recent collaborated version.
