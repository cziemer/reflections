What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository, a ,git file is created in the directory to contain the required information to track it later.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The statging area is simply the files to be connected to a commit once it is initialized. The staging area is good because changes can be temporaily set there until the user is ready to send the commit.
